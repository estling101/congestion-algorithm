## Setup in bash

### 1. Create a new, clean, environment

conda create -n congestion_env python=3.10

### 2. Activate env

conda activate congestion_env

### 3. Navigate to the project directory

cd [PATH_TO_PROJECT] (probably something like /../.../Congestion) 

### 4. Install dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt


### 5. Create kernel to be able to run multiple files automatically. 

python -m ipykernel install --user --name congestion_kernel --display-name "Congestion Kernel"

Check that it installed correctly: jupyter kernelspec list

### 6. Done! 


### 7. Usage

Congestion_Zones.ipynb is used to:
    - Run our new algorithm
    - Run Edies algorithm
    - Plot the resulting congested zones of our algorithm together with the cells that Edie produces
    - Compare total area generated by the two algoritms
    - Change accordingly
        - injected_file_path = "/real/path/to/trajectory/file/637b023440527bf2daa5932f__post1.json" to actual file if running notebook on it's own.

batch_run.py runs multiple files automatically. 
    - Change accordingly
        - file_paths = [
                "/real/path/to/trajectory/file/637b023440527bf2daa5932f__post1.json",
                "/real/path/to/trajectory/file/637c399add50d54aa5af0cf4__post2.json",
                ]
        - notebook_filename = "/real/path/to/notebook/Congestion_Zones.ipynb"
    
    - Run by:
        - python batch_run.py

runtimes_eval.py compares runtimes of cell 6 & 7 (our algorithm and edies) across the files used in batch_run.py
    - Run by:
        - python runtimes_eval.py

coverage_eval.py compares coverage between the algorithms. 
    - Run by:
        - python coverage_eval.py
